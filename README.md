# ML-DL-Stats-Notes
This repository contains my personal notes and summaries on some topics of Machine Learning, Deep learning and Statistics, which I had to learn for my interests and career development. Hope the notes can also be helpful for your technical interviews and careers.

Note that this repository is inspired from [DeepLearning.ai-Summary](https://github.com/mbadry1/DeepLearning.ai-Summary) by Mahmoud Badry which includes his notes to Andrew Ng's [deep learning specialization courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). 

# Updates
10/12/2019: The page is being updated periodically to include all the notes we have piled, so please stay tuned for more.
